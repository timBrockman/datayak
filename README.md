DATA YAK
===========

Data Yak is an open-source initiative with Orlando Data Science to analyze the growth and activity of the Orlando Tech Community. 

Specifically, Data Yak scrapes data from all of the Orlando Tech Meetups via REST API, and publishes the lastest statistics to the web. 

Data Yak is built on the [Flask Microframework,](http://flask.pocoo.org/) [MongoDB,](http://www.mongodb.org/), and [PyMongo.](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/) 

To see how all these components work together, check out [this tutorial](http://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
